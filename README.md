[Code Dx](https://codedx.com/) is an automated application vulnerability management tool that makes all of your testing tools work together to provide one set of correlated results, then helps you prioritize and manage vulnerabilities â€” integrating with your application lifecycle management tools so your security and development teams work together for faster remediation.

The Code Dx Helm chart creates an environment for development and test purposes. It may be used in production but has not been heavily tested.

## TL;DR

```
$ git clone https://github.com/codedx/codedx-kubernetes.git
$ git checkout develop
$ cd incubator/codedx
$ helm install --name codedx .
```

## Prerequisite Details

- Kubernetes 1.8+
- Code Dx license ([purchase](https://codedx.com/purchase-application/) or [request a free trial](https://codedx.com/free-trial/)) 

## Chart Details

This chart will:

- Deploy a Code Dx instance
- Deploy the MariaDB chart with master and slaves
- Create service accounts, PodSecurityPolicies, and NetworkPolicies

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with a `codedx` release name, run the following command from the incubator/codedx directory:

```
$ helm install --name codedx .
```

The chart contains a subchart reference to stable/mariadb version 5.5.0, which deploys MariaDB 10.1.37.

### Installation Recommendations

When installing the chart in a public-facing environment, you should be sure to change the passwords for Code Dx Admin, MariaDB Admin, and MariaDB Replication:

```
$ helm install --name codedx . --set codedxAdminPassword=X --set mariadb.rootUser.password=Y --set mariadb.replication.password=Z
```

It's recommended to leave PodSecurityPolicies and NetworkPolicies enabled for security.

For more configuration options, see the table below.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall a chart with a `codedx` release name, run the following command (add `--purge` to permit the reuse of the `codedx` release name):

```
$ helm delete codedx
```

To remove the MariaDB persistent volume claims, run the following command:

```
$ kubectl delete pvc data-codedx-mariadb-master-0 data-codedx-mariadb-slave-0
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Code Dx chart and their default values.

## Replication/Scalability

Code Dx does not officially support horizontal scaling. Attempting to use more than one replica for the Code Dx deployment can lead to bugs while using Code Dx, and possibly corruption of your database. Work is being done within Code Dx to better support this.

## Persistence

Code Dx will store all data in its `/opt/codedx` folder in a PersistentVolume. This includes log files, which are written both to disk and to `stdout`. The full list of data is:

- Log files from Code Dx and its tools
- Files uploaded for analysis (source code, binaries, scans)
- Temporary files (files extracted from ZIPs)

**Depending on the projects being scanned, the default size may not be sufficient. Be sure to specify an appropriate claim size when installing Code Dx.**

## Licenses

By default, Code Dx will be installed without a license. When you first navigate to Code Dx after installation, you will first be asked for a license. You can include a license during the installation process using the `license.file` and/or `license.secret` values. Note that this approach only applies for a new installation, and will have no effect afterwards.

If you have a Code Dx license file that you want to use, copy it to your current working directory and install Code Dx using helm:

```
helm install stable/codedx --name codedx --set license.file="my-codedx-license.lic"
```

Code Dx will create a Secret containing the contents of `my-codedx-license.lic`, which is mounted as a file and read by Code Dx during installation.

If you have a Code Dx license already stored as a secret, you can specify `license.secret` instead to use that existing secret:

```
helm install stable/codedx --name codedx --set license.secret="my-codedx-license-secret"
```

Note that the given secret must have a key named `license.lic`, with the contents of your Code Dx license.

## Code Dx Configuration

### General

Configuration of Code Dx itself is done through a primary ConfigMap and Secrets. A ConfigMap is generated when installing Code Dx with a `codedx.props` entry that contains common properties, such as configuration of tools, reports, and other miscellaneous behavior. To edit common Code Dx configuration, edit the `codedx.props` entry of the ConfigMap and delete the Code Dx pod to restart Code Dx with the new settings.

### Sensitive Information

Some properties, such as MariaDB or LDAP connection information, is stored in Secrets instead. These Secrets contain similar `codedx.props`-formatted content, which are also mounted as files. The file paths are then passed to Code Dx and loaded during installation and startup.

File paths are passed to Code Dx in the same ConfigMap containing common `codedx.props`, but is contained in the `tomcat.env` entry instead. This entry contains `export CATALINA_OPTS=...`, where `...` is the list of parameters to pass to Code Dx.

For loading extra `props` files, we want to add parameters such as: `-Dcodedx.additional-props-x=/path/to/props`. The `-D` part causes this parameter to be passed to Code Dx directly. Code Dx checks for any parameters starting with `codedx.additional-props` and load the file paths assigned to each.

Parameters for different files should be separated by a space, and file paths should not contain special characters or spaces for simplicity.

After making your changes to the ConfigMap, make sure the associated Secret exists in Kubernetes. Edit the Code Dx Deployment to mount your Secret as a file at the location you passed in the `-Dcodedx.additional-props...` parameter. Save and exit the editor. The old Code Dx pod should begin terminating, and a new pod will start after this completes. Check the logs for the new pod to make sure that the file was successfully loaded - the log file should contain a message such as:

```
Loaded additional props file from <YOUR-PATH> using X syntax, based on the system property <YOUR-PARAM-NAME>.
```

## Ingress

This chart can automatically create an Ingress resource for Code Dx. To do this, set `ingress.enabled=true` and add an appropriate entry to `ingress.hosts`. Setting `ingress.enabled=true` automatically sets Code Dx's Service type to `NodePort` rather than `LoadBalancer`.

An example installation with Ingress, without HTTPS:

```
helm install --name codedx \
    --set ingress.enabled=true \
    --set ingress.hosts[0].name="codedx.company.com"
    --set ingress.tls=false
```

An example with HTTPS, using an existing TLS secret:

```
helm install --name codedx \
    --set ingress.enabled=true \
    --set ingress.hosts[0].name="codedx.company.com"
    --set ingress.hosts[0].tls=true
    --set ingress.hosts[0].tlsSecret=my-tls-secret
```

An example with HTTPS, using custom annotations to enable TLS-ACME (a values.yaml file):

```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
  hosts:
  - name: codedx.company.com
    tls: true
```

**Note that the Ingress Annotations contains NGINX annotations by default to increase the read timeout and remove the proxy request body size limit.** This is to prevent errors for Code Dx live-updates and for uploading large files, respectively. If using a different Ingress implementation, make sure to include the appropriate annotations.

## Upgrading Code Dx

The Code Dx deployment is using a `Replicate` deployment strategy and only one replica by default, ensuring that no more than one instance of Code Dx is operating against a database at any given time. This is particularly important during upgrades of the Code Dx image. If a database schema update occurs while more than once instance of Code Dx is running against that database, it will lead to errors, data loss, and possibly corruption of the database.

This does mean that zero-downtime updates are not currently possible with Code Dx. Research is being done to better support this.

To upgrade Code Dx to a new version, first [find the Code Dx version to upgrade to on Docker.](https://hub.docker.com/r/codedx/codedx-tomcat/tags) **Note that only Code Dx v3.6.0 and higher are kubernetes-compatible.** Then change the image used in the Code Dx deployment. There are two approaches for this - `kubectl edit deploy` and `helm upgrade`.

Note that your license will carry over to the new version and all data will be retained if the upgrade is performed properly.

### Upgrade by Modifying the Deployment

Modify the Code Dx deployment manually with the new version via `kubectl edit deploy <codedx-deploy-name>` and change the `spec.template.spec.containers.image` property. Save and exit your editor.

### Upgrade using Helm

Navigate to the Code Dx chart directory in a terminal and run `helm upgrade --set codedxTomcatVersion=<new-codedx-image> <codedx-installation-name> .`, where:

- `<new-codedx-image>`: The full name of a Code Dx image [from docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/codedx/codedx-tomcat/tags), ie `codedx/codedx-tomcat:v3.6.0`
- `<codedx-installation-name>`: The name of the Code Dx installation, which is set when installing Code Dx via `helm install`. If installed via `helm install --name my-install ...`, the installation name would be `my-install`. If no name was specified, it will default to `codedx`.

**Be sure to include any additional values used in previous upgrades or installations.** If you passed a custom `values.yaml` file via `-f my-values.yaml`, make sure to include this file during the upgrade call. Otherwise, helm may modify Code Dx in unintended ways.

### Confirming a Successful Upgrade

Running `kubectl get pods --watch` should show the old Code Dx pod terminating. Another Code Dx pod will be created after the old pod finishes, and will begin the installation process before continuing to start up normally. Once the pod shows a status of `READY 1/1`, navigate to Code Dx and you should be able to sign in. The Code Dx version and build date on the top-right of the page should be updated accordingly.
